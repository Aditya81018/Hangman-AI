# Hangman AI

A modern, intelligent Hangman game where *you* define the theme. Instead of a static word list, this app uses Google's Gemini AI to generate unique words and hints on the fly based on your instructions.

## âœ¨ Features

This project modernizes the classic Hangman game with a powerful AI and a seamless user experience.

* **Dynamic Word Generation:** No static word lists. Every word and hint is generated by Google's Gemini AI based on your custom instructions.
* **Custom Themes:** Want to play with "Animals in the Amazon," "1990s Tech Terms," or "Shakespearean Insults"? Just type it in.
* **Difficulty Control:** Choose between **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** difficulty levels to tailor the challenge.
* **Smart AI Toggles:**
    * **Advance AI:** Opt for a more powerful AI model. This provides higher-quality, more creative words and hints (at the cost of a slightly longer initial wait).
    * **No Repeating Words:** Ensures you don't play the same word twice. The game remembers your last 100 used words.
* **âš¡ Seamless Gameplay (The Best Part):**
    Words are fetched from the AI in batches of 10. The app automatically **pre-fetches the next batch** in the background when you have 3 words left, ensuring you *never* see a loading screen between levels.
* **Full Personalization:**
    * **Favorites:** Save your favorite and most creative instruction prompts to play again later.
    * **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Get new, creative theme ideas generated by the AI based on your play history and saved favorites.
* **Persistent Storage:** All your favorites, instruction history, used words, and settings are saved directly in your browser's `localStorage`.
* **Sleek, Responsive UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a clean, modern, and fully responsive experience.

## ðŸ§  How It Works: The "Secret Sauce"

The core of this project is the intelligent batching and prefetching logic on the Game Page.

1.  **Initial Load:** The user provides instructions (e.g., "Fruits") and settings on the Home Page.
2.  **First Batch:** When the game starts, it requests a batch of 10 words and hints from the Google Gemini AI.
3.  **Gameplay:** The user plays through the words one by one.
4.  **The Trigger:** When the user reaches **Level 7** (i.e., `wordBatch.length - 3`), the app silently fires off a *new request* to the AI for 10 more words.
5.  **Seamless Transition:** This request completes in the background while the user is playing Levels 7, 8, 9, and 10. When they win Level 10 and click "Next Word," Level 11 loads *instantly* because the data is already available.

This system completely masks the AI's generation latency, creating a fast, uninterrupted, and "infinite" gameplay experience.
